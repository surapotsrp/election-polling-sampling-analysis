# 🗳️ Sampling Techniques in Election & Opinion Polling

This project explores the evolution and application of sampling techniques in U.S. election polling, comparing probability and non-probability methods. It reviews the sampling theory, practical polling techniques (e.g., RDD, RBS, IVR), and evaluates their impact on the accuracy of election predictions — especially during the 2016 U.S. election.

## 📚 Key Topics

### 🔹 Theoretical Foundations
- Probability vs. Non-probability Sampling
- Techniques: Simple random, stratified, cluster, systematic, multistage
- Sampling error, bias, margin of error

### 🔹 Practical Applications
- Polling techniques:  
  - **RDD (Random-Digit Dialing)**  
  - **RBS (Registration-Based Sampling)**  
  - **SSS (Self-Selected Sampling)**  
  - **IVR (Interactive Voice Response)**  
  - **Address-Based Sampling (ABS)**  
  - **Hybrid Methods** (Probability + Non-probability)

### 🔹 Case Analysis
- Breakdown of sampling methods in the **2016 U.S. election polls**  
- Comparison between **national vs. battleground state polls**
- Trend analysis of methodology changes **from 2000–2022**
- Impact of online opt-in polling and rise of hybrid methods

## 📊 Key Findings
- Online opt-in (non-probability) became the most-used method by 2016, but contributed to prediction errors.
- Hybrid methods like IVR (RBS + online opt-in) are rising to balance cost, reach, and accuracy.
- From 2000–2022, national pollsters increased the use of multi-method designs (e.g., 3+ sampling methods).

---

## 💡 Future Directions
- Explore **hybrid sampling + ML** for future polling accuracy.
- Emphasize representativeness and reduce selection bias in modern online panels.
